        <p>Welcome to the LinkUp Gadgets community of sellers! To ensure a safe, trusted, and fair marketplace for everyone, all vendors are required to adhere to the following policies.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Product Authenticity and Listing Accuracy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genuine Products Only:</strong> All products listed must be authentic. The sale of counterfeit, fake, or replica products is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate and permanent suspension of your account.</li>
            <li><strong>Accurate Descriptions:</strong> Product descriptions, images, and specifications must accurately represent the item for sale. Misleading information is not permitted.</li>
            <li><strong>Condition:</strong> The condition of the product (e.g., new, refurbished) must be clearly stated.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Prohibited Items</h2>
        <p>Vendors are prohibited from listing illegal items, stolen goods, or any products that violate intellectual property rights. A full list of prohibited items is available in our help center.</p>

        <h2>3. Order Fulfillment and Shipping</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Timely Shipping:</strong> Vendors are expected to process and ship orders within the timeframe specified in their listings. Prompt fulfillment is key to customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Keep buyers informed about the status of their orders. If there are delays, communicate them proactively.</li>
            <li><strong>Stock Management:</strong> You are responsible for keeping your stock quantities accurate to avoid selling items that are out of stock.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Customer Service and Disputes</h2>
        <p>Provide a high level of customer service. Respond to customer inquiries politely and in a timely manner. In the event of a dispute, LinkUp Gadgets may intervene to mediate a resolution based on the evidence provided by both the buyer and the seller.</p>

        <h2>5. Payouts</h2>
        <p>Payouts for fulfilled orders are processed on a rolling basis, typically within 7 business days after the customer has confirmed receipt of the item, minus the standard platform commission. Ensure your payment information is up-to-date to avoid delays.</p>

        <h2>6. Policy Violations</h2>
        <p>Violations of these policies may result in a range of actions, including but not limited to: listing removal, temporary or permanent selling restrictions, and account suspension. We are committed to building a trustworthy platform, and we appreciate your cooperation in upholding these standards.</p>
